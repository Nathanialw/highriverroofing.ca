                <h3>Roofing</h3>
                <h4>Throughout the year, your roof is exposed to all types of potentially damaging elements. With your roof being the only barrier between your belongings and the weather, doesn’t it go without saying that your roofing contractor should be nothing but the best?

                    There is much more to roofing than comparing prices and hiring the most affordable contractor. Roofing requires acute attention to details. These include weather, location, building, existing roof quality and the overall roofing system currently in place. All of these variables factor into the long-term performance of the new roof or repairs to be made. You wouldn’t put the same roof on a house by the ocean in a warm climate as one in British Columbia, with harsh winters and sometimes extreme conditions in both hot and cold weather. You need an expert roofing contractor to make the right decisions when it comes to products and installation.
                    
                    We have a team of professionals at hand that will analyze your situation and make the proper recommendations accordingly. Oftentimes, there is more than one solution for your new roofing system. In these cases we will walk you through the benefits and potential downfalls of each system so that you can make an informed decision. We aim to be transparent in our business with you, so there will always be someone in contact, updating you on progress, and even helping you arrange with third parties to ensure that your roofing system is equipped with everything it needs to maintain itself long term.</h4>

                <h3>Repairs</h3>
                <h4>With 24/7 emergency service available, our licensed roofing contractors will be there when you need us most. Providing efficient and effective re-roofing services, roof replacements and repairs, Carson Roofing Ltd. is available all over the Nanaimo area and north on Vancouver Island to Sayward, Campbell river, Port McNeill, Port Hardy, Port Alice, and more!

                    If your wind or water damage is covered by your insurance, we are always happy to meet with your adjuster to help them assess the damage and answer any questions they may have regarding damage replacement. Your adjuster may not know if your broken skylight needs to be completely replaced, including its surrounding flashing, or if the lid merely needs replacing. We do all we can to ensure your damages are completely covered by reviewing every last dent and damage marking so you can rest easy with complete coverage.
                    
                    If you are not sure you are eligible for a wind or water damage claim, we can help you too. Give us a call and we will inspect your roof for you. We take all the necessary pictures and write the proper reports for you to present to your insurance company in order to prove your loss. It’s that easy.</h4>
